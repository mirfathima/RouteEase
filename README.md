# RouteEase
The **RouteEase** repository contains a **Data Science and Machine Learning project** focused on analyzing traffic data. The structure of the repository, primarily featuring a Jupyter Notebook, a CSV dataset, and image files of model results, indicates the project's goal is to apply predictive modeling to traffic patterns, likely for forecasting congestion or optimizing travel routes.

## üíª Technology & Project Type

This project is a Python-based machine learning endeavor designed to run in a notebook environment.

| Category | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Language** | **Python**, executed via **Jupyter Notebook** (99.1% of the code). |
| **Data Source** | The project uses a file named `Traffic Dataset - Traffic.csv` for analysis. |
| **Machine Learning Focus** | The presence of PNG files named after standard regression algorithms suggests the project is centered on **predictive modeling** to forecast continuous variables like traffic volume or speed. |
| **Regression Models Tested** | The image files (e.g., `LR.PNG`, `RFR.PNG`, `SVR.PNG`) indicate a comparative study of **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest Regressor**, and **Support Vector Regression** models. |

## Core Functionality

The main analysis file, `ML_with_PY_DST_PROJECT.ipynb` (Machine Learning with Python DST Project), outlines the complete data science workflow:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Loading the traffic dataset.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examining the data features related to traffic conditions.
3.  **Model Training:** Implementing and training the different regression models (LR, RFR, SVR).
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing and comparing the performance of each model using metrics relevant to regression tasks (e.g., Mean Squared Error, $R^2$).
5.  **Visualization of Results:** The PNG files serve as visual summaries or charts demonstrating the comparison of the trained models' accuracy.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| Folder/File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ML_with_PY_DST_PROJECT.ipynb` | The primary execution file containing all the Python code, analysis steps, model training, and documentation. |
| `Traffic Dataset - Traffic.csv` | The raw input data used by the models for learning traffic patterns. |
| `DST pro/` | A subdirectory likely containing supplementary code, utility scripts, or specific documentation for the project. |
| `LR.PNG` | Image file showing the performance results for the **Linear Regression** model. |
| `RFR.PNG` | Image file showing the performance results for the **Random Forest Regressor** model. |
| `SVR.PNG` | Image file showing the performance results for the **Support Vector Regression** model. |

##  Getting Started

To explore or run the analysis, you will need a Python environment configured for data science.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mirfathima/RouteEase.git
    cd RouteEase
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    You will typically need to install libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
    ```bash
    # Example installation command
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
    ```
3.  **Run the Notebook:**
    Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the `ML_with_PY_DST_PROJECT.ipynb` file to step through the analysis and model training process.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
